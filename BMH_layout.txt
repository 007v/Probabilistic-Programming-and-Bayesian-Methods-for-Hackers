# Bayesian Methods for Hackers Layout

\section{ Preamble}


\section{ Introduction }
    \
    \subsection{How does bayesian inference differ?}
    \subsection{ PyMC }
    \subsection{ For the interested: We already do perform Bayesian inference! }
        #This is about least-squares solution equivilance to minimization of normal errors, similarly Lasso and Elastic Net solutions.

\section{ The greatest theorem never told }
    #This is about the *obvious* idea of Monte Carlo approximations to integrals, specifically expected values 
        
\section{ Would you rather lose an arm or a leg? }
  #Introduction to loss functions and point estimation.
  \subsection{ Loss functions for parameters}
  \subsection{ Why we should be interested in expected values }
     \subsubsection{ Optimization with scipy.optimize }
  \subsection{ Point estimate for predictions }
  

\section{What should my prior look like?}
    \subsection{Noninformative priors...}
    \subsection{Noninformative priors do not exist}
    \subsection{Good choices of priors }
  
\section{ Bayesian Networks }
    #I do not know too much about this.

\section{Naive Bayes}
    #Should this be included?
    
\section{More hacking with PyMC}
    #some examples from that PyMC website.


\section{ More examples of Bayesian analysis}
